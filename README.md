Correct URL is not provided. you need to provide a URL where your web site can be seen, NOT the GitHub repository URL where your code history can be seen. 
You have provided a wrong URL.

Instead of Heroku URLs to retrieve the data for the David Chu's China Bistro restraurant website, which we build at the end of the course, we are now using Google Firebase. The new URL is https://coursera-jhu-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/categories.json for retrieving all categories of items.

Everything is working as expected you have done a nice job. review some more assignments please as I'm waiting for someone to review mine.
